Privacy Policy

Effective Date: February 25, 2026

1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Manage My n8n Node 2 (“App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) handles information when interacting with Meta (Facebook and Instagram) APIs.

The App is used solely for automation purposes to publish content to Instagram through authorized API access.

We are committed to protecting user privacy and handling data transparently.

2. Information We Access

When a user connects their Meta (Facebook/Instagram) account to the App, we may access certain account information through Meta’s API, including:

Instagram account ID

Facebook page ID (if applicable)

Access tokens granted through Meta OAuth

Basic profile information necessary for API authentication

We only access data that is authorized through Meta’s permission system.

3. How Information Is Used

The accessed information is used solely to:

Authenticate API access

Publish content to Instagram via automation

Maintain authorized connection between Meta and n8n workflows

The App does not use data for analytics, profiling, marketing, or resale.

4. Data Storage

We do not store personal user data in our own database.

Access tokens and authentication credentials are stored only within secure infrastructure necessary for API communication and automation execution.

No personal data is sold, rented, or permanently retained outside of required authentication mechanisms.

5. Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or share user data with third parties.

Data accessed through Meta APIs is used exclusively for publishing automation functions.

6. Data Retention

Because we do not maintain a user database:

We retain access tokens only as long as the integration is active.

If a user disconnects the App from their Meta account, access is revoked immediately.

No independent long-term storage of personal data occurs.

7. Data Deletion

Users may remove this App from their Meta account at any time through:

Facebook Settings → Apps and Websites → Remove App

Once removed, the App immediately loses access to Meta account data.

For additional requests, contact:
jihwan.patrick.lee@gmail.com

We will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

8. User Rights

Depending on applicable laws, users may request:

Access to data associated with the App

Deletion of authentication tokens

Clarification of data usage

Requests can be submitted to:
jihwan.patrick.lee@gmail.com

9. Security

We implement reasonable technical safeguards to protect authentication credentials and API access.

However, no transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.

10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Updates will be posted with a revised effective date.
